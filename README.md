## Featured Projects

### Telco Customer Churn Analysis
Developed a classification model to identify customers likely to churn using logistic regression.  
Enhanced model recall from 0.51 to 0.73 by adjusting the decision threshold.  
Focused on feature importance, data preprocessing, and interpretability.

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
Built and evaluated classification models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  
Improved model performance through feature engineering, parameter tuning, and ensemble methods.  
Emphasized high recall to reduce false negatives in fraud detection.

### Emotion-Based Music Recommender
Created a system that recommends music based on user emotion derived from text input.  
Implemented text preprocessing, emotion classification, and playlist generation using Python.

### Weather Prediction Platform
Analyzed 2,000+ historical weather records to predict future conditions.  
Applied multiple machine learning models and improved accuracy by 18% using ensemble techniques.  
Included feature selection, data balancing, and evaluation metrics.
